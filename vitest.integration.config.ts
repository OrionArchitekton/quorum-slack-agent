/**
 * Integration test config for workflow pause/resume tests.
 *
 * We use manual globalSetup + setupFiles rather than the workflow() plugin
 * because the plugin's default VitestBuilder externalizes @quorum/* workspace
 * packages, which are TypeScript source with no pre-built .js output and fail
 * at Node.js ESM runtime.  Our custom global setup sets
 * bundleTransitiveLocalStepDependencies:true so those packages are bundled
 * inline into steps.mjs.
 *
 * The workflowTransformPlugin (from @workflow/rollup) still runs to handle
 * "use workflow" / "use step" directive transforms during Vite/vitest's
 * compilation of test source files.
 *
 * process.chdir("workflows/") aligns the transform plugin's process.cwd()-
 * based ID generation with the builder's cwd, so workflowId values match
 * between the source-module metadata and the bundle.
